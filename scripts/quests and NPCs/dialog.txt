Mini Quests that will introduce the player to the world of Telix. Most of these quest will be done at another part of the world. I'll indicate the location. 

Main Narrate on First Join: (Maybe this will change?)
There are a few things that we do differently. 
These quests are designed specifically for introducing our unique systems.

#They should be funneled into these systems in order that they're presented here, as they all build on eachother.

Smeltery:
  NPC: Balgoth
  Location: Tutorial Island
  Goal: Mine in the mine at spawn, and then bring Balgoth the ores.
    There he will tell you to take them to the smeltery, and smelt the ores together.

    dialog1: "<&a><&lb> <&1>Balgoth <&a><&lb><&6> Hello there <&3><player.display.name>"
    wait 3s
    dialog2: "<&6>It seems that you want to learn the ways of making Telix Steel!"
    playsound custom npc_hearty_laugh #(pseudo code)
    dialog2_5: "<&6>Sadly, you won't be making any Telix Steel today. Let's start off with some bronze."
    wait 3s
    dialog3: "<&6>Why don't you take this pickaxe and go mine some copper!"
    give tutorial_pick
    # They will mine these ores, but they won't be regular ores. They are only usable during this quest. So, like...tutorial_copper, tutorial_tin, etc.
    title "subitle:<&6>Mine 6 pieces of copper"
      --  Player mines 6 pieces of copper --
    dialog4: "<&6>What are you doing down there!? You know what. Since you're in the mine, why don't you pull up some tin as well?"
    wait 3s
    # I don't know the recipe for bronze. So, 6 copper, and 3 tin are arbitrary. The first thing they should make is a bronze sword (This will progress them to the next quest)
    dialog5: "[ Objective Updates ] Now mine 3 Tin from deeper in the mine!"
    title "subtite:<&6>Mine 3 peices of tin"
      -- Player mines 3 pieces of Tin --
    dialog6: "You did it! Now get that raw ore up here, and let me show you what a real blacksmith can do!"



        AJ:

 ## There will be some more standards, like sounds played on each milestone, and particles, and all that. But I had to go to bed. It's like 10:20. I'll finish this one tomorrow.
     It's almost done. Just a few more things that go into it. These will be on a tutorial island, and we can make the tutorial materials (Used in tutorials, and won't work anywhere else)

    When you mine a block in spawn world, it should modify block to be coal_block, and give the player the block. This will display a level of RPG, and maybe a future system. It's all about immersion.
  Reward: You keep the ingots that you just smelted, and it give you 5 copper pieces (The money)
  Note: You can't drop the ores, or the ingots that you craft/mine here. Let's make them specific to the quest. Like, tutorial_copper_ore, tutorial_bronze_ingot
