Mini Quests that will introduce the player to the world of Telix

There are a few things that we do differently. 
These quests are designed specifically for introducing our unique systems.

They should be funneled into these systems in order that they're presented here, as they all build on eachother.

Smeltery:
  NPC: Balgoth
  Goal: Mine in the mine at spawn, and then bring Balgoth the ores.
    There he will tell you to take them to the smeltery, and smelt the ores together.

    dialog1: "<&a><&lb> <&1>Balgoth <&a><&lb><&6> Hello there <&3><player.display.name>"
    wait 3s
    dialog2: "<&6>It seems that you want to learn the ways of making Telix Steel!"
    playsound custom npc_hearty_laugh (pseudo code)
    dialog2_5: "<&6>Sadly, you won't be making any Telix Steel today. Let's start off with some bronze."
    wait 3s
    dialog3: "<&6>Why don't you take this pickaxe and go mine some copper!"
    give tutorial_pick
    # They will mine these ores, but they won't be regular ores. They are only usable during this quest. So, like...tutorial_copper, tutorial_tin, etc.
    title "subitle:<&6>Mine 6 pieces of copper"
    wait 3s
      --  Player gathers 6 pieces of copper --
    dialog4: "<&6>What are you doing down there!? You know. Since you're in the mine, why don't you pull up some tin as well?"
    

    When you mine a block at spawn, it should modify block to be coal_block, and give the player the block. This will display a level of RPG, and maybe a future system. 
  Reward: You keep the ores that you just smelted, and it give you 5 copper pieces (The money)
  Note: You can't drop the ores, or the ingots that you craft here. Maybe make it so you can't drop anywhere in spawn?
